      <h2>Why One-on-One Dog Walking is Better</h2>
      <img src="../images/dogs-playing-together.jpg.jpeg" alt="Dogs enjoying their walk">
      <p>At The Woof of Walk Street, we believe in ethical dog walking — one dog at a time. Unlike pack walks, your dog gets our full attention, ensuring safety and personalized care.</p>
      <p>Every 45-minute session is devoted solely to your pup’s exercise, sniffing adventures, and playtime. No waiting in cars, no juggling multiple leashes — just quality time.</p>
